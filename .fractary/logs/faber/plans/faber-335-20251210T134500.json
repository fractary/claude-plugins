The status line should display context usage percentage and estimated session cost, but these metrics are not appearing. This requires investigation of the existing status line code, identification of the root cause, implementation of the fix, and verification that the metrics display correctly. All phases are enabled as this is a standard bug fix workflow requiring analysis, design of the fix, implementation, testing, and release via PR."
