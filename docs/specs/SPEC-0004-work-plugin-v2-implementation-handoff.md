## What Was Completed (Phases 1-5)

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fix ✅
**CRITICAL:** Fixed Release phase bug where issues weren't actually closing.

**Created:**
- `plugins/work/skills/handler-work-tracker-github/` - GitHub Issues adapter
- `plugins/work/skills/state-manager/` - State management skill
- Handler scripts:
  - `close-issue.sh` - **CRITICAL FIX** - Actually closes issues
  - `reopen-issue.sh` - Reopens closed issues
  - `update-state.sh` - Universal state transitions (open→in_progress→in_review→done→closed)
  - `list-issues.sh` - Filter issues by criteria

**Refactored:**
- `plugins/work/agents/work-manager.md` - Pure JSON router (was pseudo-code)

### Phase 2: Core Skills Refactoring ✅
**Split monolithic work-manager skill into focused skills:**

**Created Skills:**
- `issue-fetcher/` - Fetch issue details
- `issue-classifier/` - Classify work type (/bug, /feature, /chore, /patch)
- `comment-creator/` - Post comments with FABER metadata
- `label-manager/` - Add/remove labels

**Handler Scripts:**
- Moved existing: `fetch-issue.sh`, `classify-issue.sh`, `create-comment.sh`
- Updated: `add-label.sh` (simplified from set-label.sh)
- Created: `remove-label.sh` - New remove-only script

### Phase 3: New Operations ✅
**Added create, update, search, and assignment capabilities:**

**Created Skills:**
- `issue-creator/` - Create new issues
- `issue-updater/` - Update title/description
- `issue-searcher/` - Search and list issues
- `issue-assigner/` - Assign/unassign users

**Handler Scripts (NEW):**
- `create-issue.sh` - Create issues with labels and assignees
- `update-issue.sh` - Update issue metadata
- `search-issues.sh` - Full-text search
- `assign-issue.sh` - Assign to users
- `unassign-issue.sh` - Remove assignees

### Phase 4: Advanced Features ✅
**Added issue linking, milestone management, utilities, and configuration:**

**Created Skills:**
- `issue-linker/` - Create relationships between issues
- `milestone-manager/` - Manage milestones for release planning
- `work-common/` - Shared utilities library

**Handler Scripts (NEW):**
- `link-issues.sh` - Create typed relationships (relates_to, blocks, blocked_by, duplicates)
- `create-milestone.sh` - Create milestones with due dates
- `update-milestone.sh` - Update milestone properties and state
- `assign-milestone.sh` - Assign issues to milestones

**Utilities:**
- `work-common/scripts/config-loader.sh` - Load and validate configuration
- `work-common/scripts/normalize-issue.sh` - Cross-platform normalization (stub)
- `work-common/scripts/validate-issue-id.sh` - ID validation (stub)
- `work-common/scripts/error-codes.sh` - Error code reference (stub)

**Configuration:**
- `config/config.example.json` - Complete configuration template with GitHub, Jira, Linear settings

**Updated:**
- `work-manager.md` - Added routing for link, create-milestone, update-milestone, assign-milestone operations
- `handler-work-tracker-github/SKILL.md` - Documented new operations

### Phase 5: Jira Support ✅
**Added complete Jira Cloud integration with 100% feature parity to GitHub:**

**Created Handler:**
- `handler-work-tracker-jira/SKILL.md` - Complete Jira handler documentation (270 lines)
- `handler-work-tracker-jira/scripts/` - 18 handler scripts (matching GitHub)

**Utilities:**
- `work-common/scripts/markdown-to-adf.sh` - Python-based markdown → ADF converter for Jira rich text
- `work-common/scripts/jira-auth.sh` - Basic Auth helper with reusable `jira_api` function
- `work-common/scripts/jql-builder.sh` - JQL query builder from filter parameters

**Handler Scripts - Priority 1 (Critical for FABER):**
- `fetch-issue.sh` - Fetch issue details via REST API v3
- `classify-issue.sh` - Map issue type/labels → FABER work types
- `close-issue.sh` - **CRITICAL FIX** - Transitions to Done/Closed via workflow (actually closes!)
- `create-comment.sh` - Post comments with FABER metadata in ADF format

**Handler Scripts - Priority 2 (Important):**
- `reopen-issue.sh` - Reopen closed issues via workflow transitions
- `update-state.sh` - Universal state transitions (open→in_progress→in_review→done→closed)
- `create-issue.sh` - Create new Jira issues with ADF descriptions

**Handler Scripts - Priority 3 (Feature Complete):**
- `update-issue.sh` - Update issue summary and description
- `add-label.sh`, `remove-label.sh` - Label management
- `assign-issue.sh`, `unassign-issue.sh` - User assignment with account ID lookup
- `list-issues.sh`, `search-issues.sh` - JQL-based search and filtering
- `link-issues.sh` - **Native Jira issue linking** (better than GitHub!)
- `create-milestone.sh`, `update-milestone.sh`, `assign-milestone.sh` - Version/release management

**Key Features:**
- ✅ 100% feature parity with GitHub handler (18 matching scripts)
- ✅ Native Jira issue links with typed relationships (Relates, Blocks, Duplicate)
- ✅ Workflow transition support for complex Jira workflows
- ✅ Markdown → ADF conversion for descriptions and comments
- ✅ JQL query support for advanced search and filtering
- ✅ Configuration-driven state and transition mappings
- ✅ User lookup by email → accountId conversion
- ✅ Version management (Jira's milestone equivalent)

**Total:** 22 files, ~2,690 lines of code

## Breaking Changes (v2.0)

### 1. Protocol Change: String → JSON
**Old (v1.x):**
```bash
work-manager "fetch 123"
work-manager "comment 123 work-id frame 'Message'"
```

**New (v2.0):**
```bash
work-manager '{"operation":"fetch","parameters":{"issue_id":"123"}}'
work-manager '{"operation":"comment","parameters":{"issue_id":"123","work_id":"work-id","author_context":"frame","message":"Message"}}'
```

### 2. Architecture: Monolithic → Focused Skills
**Old:** Single `work-manager` skill with all logic
**New:** 9 focused skills + 1 handler

### 3. Critical Fix: close-issue Actually Works
**Old:** Release phase only posted comment, didn't close issue
**New:** `state-manager` skill invokes `close-issue.sh` which actually closes

---

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure gh CLI is installed and authenticated
gh auth login

# Navigate to repository
cd /mnt/c/GitHub/fractary/claude-plugins
```

### Test Critical Bug Fix (close-issue)
```bash
# Test close operation (MOST IMPORTANT)
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"close","parameters":{"issue_id":"123","close_comment":"Test close","work_id":"test"}}'

# Verify issue is actually closed on GitHub
gh issue view 123 --json state
# Should show: "state": "CLOSED"
```

### Test Core Operations
```bash
# Test fetch
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"fetch","parameters":{"issue_id":"123"}}'

# Test classify
issue_json='{"id":"123","title":"Fix crash","labels":["bug"]}'
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"classify","parameters":{"issue_json":"'"$issue_json"'"}}'

# Test comment
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"comment","parameters":{"issue_id":"123","work_id":"test","author_context":"frame","message":"Test comment"}}'

# Test label operations
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"label","parameters":{"issue_id":"123","label_name":"test-label","action":"add"}}'
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"label","parameters":{"issue_id":"123","label_name":"test-label","action":"remove"}}'

# Test state transitions
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"update-state","parameters":{"issue_id":"123","target_state":"in_progress"}}'
```

### Test New Operations (Phase 3)
```bash
# Test create
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"create","parameters":{"title":"Test issue","description":"Test description","labels":"test"}}'

# Test update
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"update","parameters":{"issue_id":"123","title":"Updated title"}}'

# Test search
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"search","parameters":{"query_text":"login crash","limit":10}}'

# Test list
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"list","parameters":{"state":"open","labels":"bug","limit":20}}'

# Test assign
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"assign","parameters":{"issue_id":"123","assignee_username":"username"}}'

# Test unassign
claude --agent work-manager '{"operation":"unassign","parameters":{"issue_id":"123","assignee_username":"username"}}'
```

### Test with FABER Workflow
```bash
# The ultimate test - run a complete FABER workflow
/faber run 123 --autonomy guarded

# Verify:
# 1. Frame phase fetches and classifies issue ✓
# 2. Each phase posts comments ✓
# 3. Labels are added (faber-in-progress) ✓
# 4. Release phase ACTUALLY CLOSES the issue ✓ (THIS WAS BROKEN BEFORE)
# 5. Labels are updated (faber-completed) ✓
```

---

## Integration with FABER

### Frame Phase Integration
**Operations Used:** fetch, classify, add-label, comment

**Flow:**
```
Frame Manager → work-manager
  → issue-fetcher → handler-work-tracker-github/fetch-issue.sh
  → Returns normalized issue JSON

Frame Manager → work-manager
  → issue-classifier → handler-work-tracker-github/classify-issue.sh
  → Returns /bug | /feature | /chore | /patch

Frame Manager → work-manager
  → label-manager → handler-work-tracker-github/add-label.sh
  → Adds "faber-in-progress" label

Frame Manager → work-manager
  → comment-creator → handler-work-tracker-github/create-comment.sh
  → Posts "Frame phase started" comment
```

### Release Phase Integration (CRITICAL FIX)
**Operations Used:** close, remove-label, add-label, comment

**OLD BROKEN FLOW (v1.x):**
```
Release Manager → work-manager "update 123 closed work-id"
  → Only posted comment
  → Issue remained OPEN ❌
```

**NEW FIXED FLOW (v2.0):**
```
Release Manager → work-manager
  → state-manager → handler-work-tracker-github/close-issue.sh
  → gh issue close 123
  → Issue actually closes ✅

Release Manager → work-manager
  → label-manager → remove "faber-in-progress", add "faber-completed"

Release Manager → work-manager
  → comment-creator → Post "Release complete" with PR link
```

### FABER Configuration
Update `.faber.config.toml`:
```toml
[project]
issue_system = "github"  # Tells FABER which work tracking system

[workflow]
auto_close_issue = true  # Enable auto-close on successful release
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Pure Router Pattern
**Decision:** work-manager agent is a pure router, no operation logic
**Rationale:**
- Single responsibility (routing only)
- Easy to test
- Easy to extend (add new operations → add new skills)
- Follows repo plugin pattern

### 2. Focused Skills Pattern
**Decision:** One skill per operation type (9 skills total)
**Rationale:**
- Smaller context per operation
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain and test
- Each skill can evolve independently

### 3. Handler Pattern for Platform Abstraction
**Decision:** All platform-specific logic in handler skills
**Rationale:**
- Skills remain platform-agnostic
- Easy to add new platforms (Jira, Linear)
- Platform quirks isolated
- Configuration-driven (no code changes to switch platforms)

### 4. Scripts Outside LLM Context
**Decision:** All deterministic operations execute in shell scripts via Bash tool
**Rationale:**
- 55-60% context reduction
- Scripts are testable independently
- Faster iteration (no LLM needed for script changes)
- Idempotent and deterministic

### 5. JSON Protocol (Breaking Change)
**Decision:** Switch from string-based to JSON-based protocol
**Rationale:**
- Type-safe parameters
- Easy to validate
- Future-proof (easy to add fields)
- Better error messages
- Consistent with modern APIs

### 6. Universal State Model
**Decision:** Abstract platform states to universal model
**Rationale:**
- GitHub: 2 states (open/closed) + labels for intermediate
- Jira: Complex workflow transitions
- Linear: Team-specific states
- Universal model allows same code to work across platforms

---

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

### 1. Old work-manager Skill Not Removed
**Location:** `plugins/work/skills/work-manager/`
**Issue:** Legacy monolithic skill still exists
**Fix:** Delete in Phase 7 cleanup
**Risk:** Low (not referenced by new architecture)

### 2. No Configuration File Yet
**Issue:** Plugin requires `.faber/plugins/work/config.json` but no example provided
**Fix:** Create `config/config.example.json` in Phase 4
**Workaround:** Handler scripts fall back to gh CLI authentication

### 3. No Backward Compatibility Layer
**Issue:** v1.x string protocol no longer works
**Impact:** Breaking change for existing FABER workflows
**Mitigation:** Update FABER specs to use new JSON protocol
**Future:** Could add compatibility layer in agent if needed

### 4. Handler Error Handling Could Be More Robust
**Issue:** Some edge cases in error detection (network errors, rate limits)
**Fix:** Enhance error handling in scripts
**Priority:** Medium (current implementation handles common cases)

### 5. No Rate Limit Management
**Issue:** No automatic retry or rate limit tracking
**Impact:** May hit GitHub API limits with heavy usage
**Fix:** Add exponential backoff and rate limit headers parsing
**Priority:** Low (unlikely in normal usage)

---

## Next Session Prompt

### If Continuing Implementation (Phases 4-7):

```
I need to continue implementing the work plugin v2.0. Phases 1-3 (MVP) are complete and committed (519f7c0).

Current state:
- ✅ 9 focused skills created
- ✅ 1 handler (GitHub) with 14 scripts
- ✅ Critical bug fix (close-issue works)
- ✅ JSON protocol implemented
- ✅ Universal state model

Next steps (choose one):
1. Phase 4: Add linking, milestones, utilities (3-4h)
2. Phase 5: Jira support (10-12h) - requires Jira access
3. Phase 6: Linear support (10-12h) - requires Linear access
4. Phase 7: Cleanup and documentation (4-5h)

Please read:
- docs/specs/fractary-work-plugin-specification.md (full spec)
- docs/specs/work-plugin-v2-next-steps.md (this file)

Then implement [PHASE NUMBER] following the specification.
```

### If Testing Current Implementation:

```
I need to test the work plugin v2.0 MVP that was just implemented (commit 519f7c0).

Critical test: Verify Release phase can actually close issues (this was the main bug fix).

Please:
1. Read docs/specs/work-plugin-v2-next-steps.md for testing instructions
2. Test close-issue operation with a test GitHub issue
3. Test fetch, classify, comment, and label operations
4. Test new create, update, search, assign operations
5. If possible, run a FABER workflow end-to-end to verify integration

Report any issues found.
```

### If Integrating with FABER:

```
I need to update FABER workflow managers to use the new work plugin v2.0 JSON protocol (commit 519f7c0).

The protocol changed from string-based to JSON-based:
- Old: work-manager "fetch 123"
- New: work-manager '{"operation":"fetch","parameters":{"issue_id":"123"}}'

Critical: Release phase must use new "close" operation to actually close issues.

Please:
1. Read docs/specs/work-plugin-v2-next-steps.md (Integration with FABER section)
2. Update Frame Manager to use fetch and classify operations
3. Update Release Manager to use close operation (CRITICAL FIX)
4. Update all phase managers to use comment operation with new format
5. Test complete FABER workflow

Focus on plugins/faber/ workflow managers.
```
