# Audit Command

Audit documentation against fractary-docs standards and generate actionable remediation specification.

<ARGUMENT_SYNTAX>
## Command Argument Syntax

This command follows the standard space-separated syntax:
- **Format**: `--flag value` (NOT `--flag=value`)
- **Multi-word values**: MUST be enclosed in double quotes

### Examples

```bash
# Correct ✅
/fractary-docs:audit
/fractary-docs:audit --project-root ./my-project
/fractary-docs:audit --execute

# Incorrect ❌
/fractary-docs:audit --project-root=./my-project
/fractary-docs:audit --execute=true
```
</ARGUMENT_SYNTAX>

## Usage

```bash
/fractary-docs:audit [--project-root <path>] [--execute]
```

## When to Use This Command

**Use `/fractary-docs:audit` to:**
- ✅ Check documentation compliance with current standards
- ✅ Identify quality issues and gaps
- ✅ Generate actionable remediation plan
- ✅ Audit after standards evolve
- ✅ Regular documentation health checks

**Use `/fractary-docs:adopt` instead if:**
- ⚠️ First-time adoption (no fractary-docs config yet)
- ⚠️ Need to migrate custom document agent
- ⚠️ Need to generate initial configuration

## Parameters

- `--project-root`: Root directory to audit. **Defaults to current directory.**
- `--execute`: Execute high-priority remediations immediately after audit. Defaults to false (generate spec only).

## What This Does

### Two-Phase Interactive Audit Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: This command uses a two-phase workflow with mandatory user approval:

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Presentation (Automatic)

1. **Load Configuration & Standards**
   - Load fractary-docs configuration
   - Load project-specific standards (if configured)
   - Determine applicable validation rules

2. **Discover Current State**
   - Scan all documentation files
   - Analyze organization and structure
   - Check front matter coverage
   - Assess quality scores

3. **Compare Against Standards**
   - **Plugin standards**: Front matter, organization, required sections
   - **Project standards**: Custom rules from project standards doc
   - Identify compliance gaps and issues

4. **Present Findings for Review**
   - Show detailed findings and proposed actions
   - Display priority breakdown (high, medium, low)
   - Estimate effort required
   - **PAUSE for user approval**

#### Phase 2: Specification Generation (After Approval)

5. **Generate Remediation Specification** (Only if approved)
   - Create actionable remediation plan
   - **Uses fractary-spec plugin** if available for standardized spec
   - Include executable commands and verification steps
   - Save to `.fractary/audit/REMEDIATION-SPEC.md`

6. **Optional Execution** (if --execute flag)
   - Execute high-priority remediations automatically
   - Report results

**User Options After Phase 1:**
- **Approve**: Generate the spec as proposed
- **Revise**: Provide feedback to adjust the proposed actions
- **Cancel**: Stop without generating spec (findings saved for reference)

## Output

The audit produces:

### Remediation Specification (Markdown)
- `REMEDIATION-SPEC.md` - Actionable plan to fix issues
  - Issue summary by priority
  - Detailed requirements with rationale
  - Phase-based implementation plan
  - Executable commands
  - Verification steps

### Discovery Reports (JSON)
- `discovery-docs.json` - Documentation inventory
- `discovery-structure.json` - Organization analysis
- `discovery-frontmatter.json` - Front matter coverage
- `discovery-quality.json` - Quality assessment

## Examples

**Basic audit in current directory:**
```bash
cd /path/to/my-project
/fractary-docs:audit
```

**Audit specific project:**
```bash
/fractary-docs:audit --project-root ./services/api
```

**Audit and execute high-priority fixes:**
```bash
/fractary-docs:audit --execute
```

**Regular compliance check:**
```bash
# Run weekly or after standards updates
/fractary-docs:audit

# Review spec
cat .fractary/audit/REMEDIATION-SPEC.md

# Execute in separate session if needed
```

## Audit Scenarios

### Scenario 1: After Standards Update

**Situation:**
- Plugin standards evolved
- Need to update docs to new requirements

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Audit against new standards
/fractary-docs:audit

# Review what changed
cat .fractary/audit/REMEDIATION-SPEC.md

# Follow spec to update docs
```

### Scenario 2: Regular Compliance Check

**Situation:**
- Quarterly documentation review
- Check for quality drift

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Audit current state
/fractary-docs:audit

# Review issues found
# Address high-priority items
# Schedule medium/low priority for later
```

### Scenario 3: After Major Documentation Changes

**Situation:**
- Added many new docs
- Merged documentation from another project
- Need to ensure compliance

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Audit to identify issues
/fractary-docs:audit

# Auto-fix high-priority
/fractary-docs:audit --execute

# Manually review remaining issues
```

```

## Revision Workflow

If you want to adjust the proposed remediation actions after seeing Phase 1 findings:

1. **Review the findings**: Examine the proposed actions, priorities, and estimated effort
2. **Provide feedback**: Tell Claude what you'd like to adjust:
   - Change priority of specific actions
   - Remove actions that aren't needed
   - Add additional remediation actions
   - Adjust scope or approach
3. **Approve revised plan**: Once you're satisfied with the adjustments
4. **Generate spec**: Claude will then generate the spec with your revisions

**Example revision conversation:**
```
You: I'd like to revise the plan. Can we:
     1. Move "Add missing ADR sections" from high to medium priority
     2. Remove the action to reorganize all files (too disruptive right now)
     3. Add an action to set up automated validation

Claude: [Presents revised plan with your changes]

You: That looks good, please generate the spec

Claude: [Generates spec with revised actions]
```

## Use Cases

### Initial Post-Adoption Audit

After adopting fractary-docs, verify everything is compliant:

```bash
# After following adoption spec
/fractary-docs:audit

# Should show minimal issues
# Address any remaining compliance gaps
```

### Continuous Compliance

Regular audits to maintain documentation quality:

```bash
# Weekly or monthly
/fractary-docs:audit

# Track compliance trends over time
# Address quality drift proactively
```

### Before Major Releases

Ensure documentation is release-ready:

```bash
# Pre-release audit
/fractary-docs:audit --execute

# Fix critical issues automatically
# Manually review remaining items
```

## Comparison: Audit vs Adopt

| Feature | Audit | Adopt |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Check compliance | Initial migration |
| **Config Required** | Yes | No (generates config) |
| **Custom Agent Migration** | No | Yes |
| **When to Use** | Ongoing compliance | First time setup |
| **Output** | Remediation spec | Config + remediation spec |

## Requirements

Before running audit:

- fractary-docs must be configured
- Configuration at `.fractary/plugins/docs/config/config.json`
- Documentation files present in project

## Next Steps After Audit

1. **Review remediation spec thoroughly**
