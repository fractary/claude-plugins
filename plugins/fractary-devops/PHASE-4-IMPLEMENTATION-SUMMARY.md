Phase 4 successfully delivers the natural language interface and production-ready polish to complete v1.0 of the fractary-devops Claude Code plugin. All success criteria met, all deliverables completed.

---

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. devops-director Agent ✅

**File:** `agents/devops-director.md`
