## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Check Health

```bash
/fractary-devops:ops-manage check-health --env=test

# Output:
📊 STARTING: Operations Monitoring
Environment: test
Checking all services
───────────────────────────────────────
✓ Found 5 resources to monitor
✓ Monitoring completed for 5 resources
✅ COMPLETED: Operations Monitoring
Status: HEALTHY
Resources Checked: 5
Healthy: 5 / Degraded: 0 / Unhealthy: 0
```

### Example 2: Query Logs

/fractary-devops:ops-manage query-logs --env=prod --service=api-lambda --filter=ERROR

# Output:
🔧 OPERATIONS MANAGER: query-logs
Environment: prod
Service: api-lambda
───────────────────────────────────────
Found 12 ERROR entries in last hour:

2025-10-28 15:30:00 ERROR: Database connection timeout
2025-10-28 15:31:15 ERROR: Database connection timeout
2025-10-28 15:32:40 ERROR: Database connection timeout
...

Would you like to investigate these errors? (yes/no)
```

### Example 3: Investigate Incident

```bash
/fractary-devops:ops-manage investigate --env=prod --service=api-lambda --timeframe=2h

# Output:
Incident Report
===============
Service: api-lambda
Timeframe: Last 2 hours
Status: DEGRADED

Timeline:
- 13:00: Service operating normally (0.1% error rate)
- 14:15: Error rate spike to 2.5%
- 14:20: Database connections exhausted
- 14:25: Continued elevated errors
- 15:00: Error rate remains at 2.3%

Root Cause:
Database connection pool exhausted due to increased traffic
and slow query performance.

Affected Resources:
- api-lambda (errors: 2.3%)
- database-rds (connections: 98/100)

Recommendations:
1. Increase database connection pool size
2. Optimize slow queries
3. Consider Lambda reserved concurrency
4. Add connection retry logic

Apply remediation? (yes/no)
```

### Example 4: Apply Remediation

```bash
/fractary-devops:ops-manage remediate --env=prod --service=api-lambda --action=restart

# Output:
⚠️  WARNING: Production Remediation
You are about to RESTART api-lambda in PRODUCTION.
This may cause brief service interruption.

Impact Assessment:
- Service: api-lambda
- Action: Restart
- Expected downtime: 5-10 seconds
- Traffic impact: Brief 503 errors possible

Continue? (yes/no)
> yes

Applying remediation...
✓ Lambda function restarted
✓ Verifying health...
✓ Health check passed
✅ Service operational

Remediation documented and logged.
```

### Example 5: Cost Audit

```bash
/fractary-devops:ops-manage audit --env=test --focus=cost

# Output:
Cost Audit Report
=================
Environment: test
Period: Last 30 days
Current Monthly Cost: $127.50

Cost Breakdown:
1. RDS (db-instance)        $85.00  (67%)
2. Lambda (api-lambda)      $22.00  (17%)
3. S3 (uploads-bucket)      $10.50  (8%)
4. API Gateway              $8.00   (6%)
5. CloudWatch               $2.00   (2%)

Optimization Opportunities:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HIGH PRIORITY ($40/month savings)
└─ Right-size RDS instance
   Current: db.t3.medium ($85/month)
   Recommended: db.t3.small ($45/month)
   Reason: CPU utilization <25%, memory usage <40%

MEDIUM PRIORITY ($4/month savings)
└─ Enable Lambda Graviton2
   Estimated savings: 20% on Lambda costs

LOW PRIORITY ($2/month savings)
└─ Enable S3 Intelligent Tiering
   Move infrequently accessed objects automatically

Total Potential Savings: $46/month (36% reduction)

  ↓
ops-monitor (identifies unhealthy resource)
  ↓
ops-manager suggests investigation
  ↓
ops-investigator (analyzes logs, correlates events)

```

### Integration with Infrastructure Management

```
Phase 1 (Infrastructure):
  infra-manager → deploy → resources created

Phase 2 (Testing):
  infra-tester → verify deployment → post-deployment tests

Phase 3 (Operations):
  ops-monitor → health check → ongoing monitoring
  ops-investigator → incident response
  ops-auditor → continuous optimization
```

## Integration Summary

### Complete DevOps Lifecycle

**Phase 1:** Infrastructure Management
- Design → Engineer → Validate → Preview → Deploy

**Phase 2:** Testing & Debugging
- Pre-deployment tests → Security scans → Cost estimation
- Post-deployment verification
- Error debugging with learning

**Phase 3:** Runtime Operations
- Health monitoring → Incident investigation → Remediation
- Cost/security auditing → Continuous optimization

### End-to-End Example

```
1. infra-manager architect --feature="API service"
   → Design created

2. infra-manager engineer --design=api-service.md
   → Terraform code generated

3. infra-manager deploy --env=test
   → infra-tester runs security scans
   → infra-previewer shows plan
   → infra-deployer deploys resources
   → infra-tester runs post-deployment tests
   → ops-monitor checks health
   ✅ Deployment complete and healthy

4. ops-monitor check-health --env=test
   → All resources healthy

5. [Later: Issue occurs]

6. ops-monitor check-health --env=test
   → Detects degraded Lambda

7. ops-manager investigate --service=api-lambda
   → ops-investigator analyzes logs
   → Root cause: Database connection timeout

8. ops-manager remediate --service=api-lambda --action=restart
   → ops-responder restarts service
   → ops-monitor verifies health
   ✅ Issue resolved

9. ops-manager audit --focus=cost
   → ops-auditor analyzes costs
   → Recommends right-sizing
   → Potential savings: $46/month
```

---

## Standards Compliance

✅ Follows FRACTARY-PLUGIN-STANDARDS.md patterns
✅ Manager owns complete operational workflow
✅ Skills are single-purpose execution units
✅ Handler abstracts CloudWatch operations
✅ Skills document their work (monitoring reports, incident reports)
✅ Production safety enforced at multiple levels
✅ XML markup standards followed consistently

---

## Known Limitations

1. **AWS Only**: Phase 3 supports AWS CloudWatch only (GCP/Azure in Phase 5)
2. **Simplified Cost Analysis**: Uses basic calculations (full AWS Cost Explorer integration possible)
3. **Manual Remediation Verification**: Some remediations require manual verification
4. **Limited Auto-Remediation**: Most remediations require confirmation
5. **No Alerting**: Monitoring is on-demand (automated alerting possible in future)

---

## Performance Characteristics

**Health Checks:**
- Resource status queries: 1-2 seconds per resource
- Metrics collection: 2-5 seconds per resource
- Total for 10 resources: ~20-35 seconds

**Log Queries:**
- Simple filter: 2-5 seconds
- Complex investigation: 10-30 seconds
- Depends on log volume and time range

**Remediations:**
- Restart Lambda: 5-10 seconds
- Scale ECS: 30-60 seconds
- Verification: 10-20 seconds

---

### Phase 4: Natural Language & Polish
- devops-director agent for natural language interface
- Complete user documentation
- Error handling improvements
- Performance optimization

---

## Ready for Production Operations

Phase 3 is **complete and ready** for:
- Daily health monitoring of deployed infrastructure
- Incident investigation and response
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Cost optimization and security auditing
- Operational excellence practices

The foundation is complete for Phase 4 polish and natural language interface.
