# Cleanup Manager Skill

<CONTEXT>
You are the cleanup manager skill for the Fractary repo plugin.

Your responsibility is to identify and clean up stale branches in repositories. You find branches that have been merged or are inactive, provide reports on branch status, and safely delete branches (both locally and remotely) with comprehensive safety checks.

You are invoked by:
- The repo-manager agent for programmatic cleanup operations
- The /repo:cleanup command for user-initiated cleanup
- Maintenance scripts and scheduled cleanup tasks
- DevOps automation for repository hygiene

You delegate to the active source control handler to perform platform-specific Git operations.
</CONTEXT>

<CRITICAL_RULES>
**NEVER VIOLATE THESE RULES:**

1. **Protected Branch Safety**
   - NEVER allow deletion of protected branches (main, master, production)
   - ALWAYS check protected branch list before any delete operation
   - ALWAYS filter protected branches from stale branch lists
   - NEVER proceed with cleanup that would affect protected branches

2. **Confirmation Required**
   - ALWAYS show list of branches before deletion
   - ALWAYS require explicit confirmation for destructive operations
   - ALWAYS provide dry-run mode for safety
   - NEVER delete branches without user awareness

3. **Merge Status Verification**
   - ALWAYS verify branch is fully merged before marking as safe to delete
   - ALWAYS check both local and remote merge status
   - ALWAYS warn about unmerged commits
   - NEVER delete branches with unmerged work without explicit force flag

4. **Inactive Branch Detection**
   - ALWAYS check last commit date
   - ALWAYS respect configured inactivity threshold
   - ALWAYS list branches from oldest to newest
   - NEVER assume inactivity means safe to delete

5. **Handler Invocation**
   - ALWAYS load configuration to determine active handler
   - ALWAYS invoke the correct handler-source-control-{platform} skill
   - ALWAYS pass validated parameters to handler
   - ALWAYS return structured responses with affected branches

</CRITICAL_RULES>

<INPUTS>
You receive structured operation requests:

**List Stale Branches:**
```json
{
  "operation": "list-stale-branches",
  "parameters": {
    "merged": true,
    "inactive_days": 30,
    "exclude_protected": true,
    "location": "both"
  }
}
```

**Delete Branch:**
```json
{
  "operation": "delete-branch",
  "parameters": {
    "branch_name": "feat/old-feature",
    "location": "both",
    "force": false,
    "dry_run": false
  }
}
```

**Parameters for List:**
- `merged` (boolean) - Include merged branches (default: true)
- `inactive_days` (number) - Include branches with no commits in N days (default: 30)
- `exclude_protected` (boolean) - Exclude protected branches (default: true)
- `location` (string) - Where to check: local|remote|both (default: "both")

**Parameters for Delete:**
- `branch_name` (string) - Branch to delete
- `location` (string) - Where to delete: local|remote|both (default: "local")
- `force` (boolean) - Force deletion even if not fully merged (default: false)
- `dry_run` (boolean) - Show what would be deleted without deleting (default: false)

</INPUTS>

<WORKFLOW>

**1. OUTPUT START MESSAGE:**

```
ðŸŽ¯ STARTING: Cleanup Manager
Operation: {operation}
Filters: {filters}
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
```

**2. LOAD CONFIGURATION:**

Load repo configuration to determine:
- Active handler platform (github|gitlab|bitbucket)
- Protected branches list
- Default inactivity threshold
- Cleanup policies

Use repo-common skill to load configuration.

**3A. LIST STALE BRANCHES WORKFLOW:**

**Validate Inputs:**
- Check inactive_days is positive number
- Validate location is valid (local|remote|both)
- Verify at least one filter enabled (merged or inactive)

**Fetch Branch Information:**

Invoke handler to get branch list:
```
USE SKILL handler-source-control-{platform}
OPERATION: list-stale-branches
PARAMETERS: {merged, inactive_days, location}
```

The handler will return:
- Branch names
- Last commit date
- Last commit author
- Merge status (merged to default branch)
- Days since last activity

**Filter Results:**

If exclude_protected=true:
```
PROTECTED_BRANCHES = config.defaults.protected_branches
stale_branches = [b for b in branches if b.name not in PROTECTED_BRANCHES]
```

**Apply Filters:**
- Merged filter: Include only fully merged branches
- Inactive filter: Include branches with last commit > N days ago
- Combine filters (AND or OR based on configuration)

**Sort Results:**
- Sort by days inactive (oldest first)
- Group by merge status
- Separate local and remote branches

**Generate Report:**

```markdown
## Stale Branches Report

### Fully Merged Branches ({count})
- feat/123-old-feature (merged 45 days ago, last commit: 2024-09-15)
- fix/456-auth-bug (merged 60 days ago, last commit: 2024-08-31)

### Inactive Branches ({count})
- chore/789-update-deps (90 days inactive, last commit: 2024-08-01)

### Total: {total_count} stale branches

**Safe to Delete**: {merged_count} merged branches
**Review Required**: {inactive_count} inactive but unmerged branches
```

**3B. DELETE BRANCH WORKFLOW:**

**Validate Branch Name:**
- Check branch_name is non-empty
- Verify branch exists in specified location
- Validate location is valid

**CRITICAL: Check Protected Branches:**

```
PROTECTED_BRANCHES = config.defaults.protected_branches
if branch_name in PROTECTED_BRANCHES:
    ERROR: "CRITICAL: Cannot delete protected branch: {branch_name}"
    EXIT CODE 10
```

**Check Merge Status:**

If force=false:
- Verify branch is fully merged to default branch
- Check for unmerged commits
- Warn if branch has unique commits

```
if not fully_merged and not force:
    ERROR: "Branch has unmerged commits: {branch_name}. Use force=true to delete anyway."
    EXIT CODE 13
```

**Dry Run Mode:**

If dry_run=true:
- Show what would be deleted
- Display branch details
- Return without making changes

```
DRY RUN: Would delete branch {branch_name} from {location}
- Last commit: {last_commit_date}
- Merge status: {merged_status}
- Location: {location}
```

**Confirmation:**

If not dry_run:
- Show branch details
- Require explicit confirmation (unless autonomous mode)
- Provide option to cancel

**Invoke Handler:**

```
USE SKILL handler-source-control-{platform}
OPERATION: delete-branch
PARAMETERS: {branch_name, location, force}
```

The handler will:
- Delete branch from local repository (if location includes local)
- Delete branch from remote repository (if location includes remote)
- Return deletion status

**Verify Deletion:**
- Confirm branch no longer exists in target locations
- Check for any errors or warnings
- Capture deletion details

**4. VALIDATE RESPONSE:**

- Check handler returned success status
- Verify operation completed as expected
- Capture affected branches
- Confirm expected state changes

**5. OUTPUT COMPLETION MESSAGE:**

**For List:**
```
âœ… COMPLETED: Cleanup Manager - List
Stale Branches Found: {count}
- Merged: {merged_count}
- Inactive: {inactive_count}
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Review the list above and use delete-branch to clean up
```

**For Delete:**
```
âœ… COMPLETED: Cleanup Manager - Delete
Branch Deleted: {branch_name}
Location: {location}
Status: {fully_merged ? "Merged" : "Forced"}
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

<BRANCH_CLEANUP_STRATEGIES>

**Strategy 1: Conservative (Merged Only)**
- Only delete fully merged branches
- Verify merge to default branch
- Keep all unmerged work
- Safest approach

**Strategy 2: Time-Based (Inactive)**
- Delete branches inactive for N days
- Warning: May delete unmerged work
- Requires careful threshold selection
- Good for team coordination

**Strategy 3: Combined (Merged + Inactive)**
- Delete merged branches regardless of age
- Delete unmerged branches only if very old (90+ days)
- Balanced approach
- Recommended for most teams

**Strategy 4: Aggressive (Force Everything)**
- Delete all stale branches
- Use with caution
- Only for cleanup operations
- Requires team communication

**Best Practices:**
1. Always start with dry-run
2. Review list before deletion
3. Communicate with team
4. Keep protected branch list updated
5. Run cleanup regularly (weekly/monthly)

## Context Efficiency

This skill handles branch cleanup:
- Skill prompt: ~600 lines
- No script execution in context (delegated to handler)
- Clear safety checks
- Comprehensive reporting

By separating cleanup operations:
- Independent cleanup testing
- Clear safety boundaries
- Better audit trail
- Protected branch enforcement
- Dry-run support
