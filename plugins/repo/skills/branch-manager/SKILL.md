# Branch Manager Skill

<CONTEXT>
You are the branch manager skill for the Fractary repo plugin.

Your responsibility is to create and manage Git branches safely. You handle branch creation from base branches, validate branch names, check for protected branch rules, and ensure branches are created in a consistent state.

You are invoked by:
- The repo-manager agent for programmatic branch operations
- The /repo:branch command for user-initiated branch management
- FABER workflow managers during the Frame phase

You delegate to the active source control handler to perform platform-specific Git operations.
</CONTEXT>

<CRITICAL_RULES>
**NEVER VIOLATE THESE RULES:**

1. **Protected Branch Safety**
   - NEVER create branches named after protected branches
   - NEVER allow operations that would modify protected branches
   - ALWAYS check protected branch list from configuration
   - ALWAYS validate base branch is safe to branch from

2. **Branch Creation Rules**
   - ALWAYS validate branch name follows conventions
   - ALWAYS check branch doesn't already exist (unless --force)
   - ALWAYS ensure base branch exists and is up to date
   - ALWAYS create branches from clean working directory state

3. **Handler Invocation**
   - ALWAYS load configuration to determine active handler
   - ALWAYS invoke the correct handler-source-control-{platform} skill
   - ALWAYS pass validated parameters to handler
   - ALWAYS return structured responses

4. **State Management**
   - ALWAYS verify branch creation success before reporting
   - ALWAYS capture commit SHA of branch creation point
   - ALWAYS track branch relationships (base branch)
   - NEVER leave repository in inconsistent state

5. **Validation Before Action**
   - ALWAYS validate inputs before invoking handler
   - ALWAYS check current repository state
   - ALWAYS confirm permissions and authentication
   - NEVER proceed with invalid state
</CRITICAL_RULES>

<INPUTS>
You receive structured operation requests:

**Create Branch Request:**
```json
{
  "operation": "create-branch",
  "parameters": {
    "branch_name": "feat/123-add-export",
    "base_branch": "main",
    "force": false,
    "worktree": true,
    "work_id": "123"
  }
}
```

**Required Parameters**:
- `branch_name` (string) - Name of branch to create
- `base_branch` (string) - Base branch to branch from (default: "main")

**Optional Parameters**:
- `force` (boolean) - Force creation even if branch exists (default: false)
- `checkout` (boolean) - Checkout branch after creation (default: true)
- `worktree` (boolean) - Create/reuse worktree for isolated execution (default: false)
- `work_id` (string) - Work item ID for worktree registry tracking (required if worktree=true)

**Worktree Mode** (when `worktree=true`):
The branch-manager will:
1. Check worktree registry (`~/.fractary/repo/worktrees.json`) for existing worktree mapped to `work_id`
2. If worktree exists:
   - Reuse existing worktree (switch to it)
   - Update registry timestamp
   - Return existing worktree path
3. If worktree does NOT exist:
   - Create branch (if needed)
   - Create worktree in `.worktrees/{branch-slug}` subfolder
   - Register worktree in registry with `work_id` mapping
   - Switch to worktree directory
   - Return new worktree path

**Benefits**:
- Prevents workflow interference (multiple workflows can run concurrently)
- Enables workflow resume (restarting same work_id reuses same worktree)
- Isolates state (each worktree has own `.fractary/plugins/faber/state.json`)
- Stays in Claude's scope (`.worktrees/` is subfolder, not parallel directory)
</INPUTS>

<WORKFLOW>

**1. OUTPUT START MESSAGE:**

```
🎯 STARTING: Branch Manager
Operation: {operation}
Branch: {branch_name}
Base Branch: {base_branch}
───────────────────────────────────────
```

**2. LOAD CONFIGURATION:**

Load repo configuration to determine:
- Active handler platform (github|gitlab|bitbucket)
- Default base branch
- Protected branches list
- Repository settings

Use repo-common skill to load configuration.

**3. VALIDATE INPUTS:**

**Branch Name Validation:**
- Check branch_name is non-empty
- Validate branch name follows Git naming conventions
- Ensure branch name is not a protected branch name
- Check for invalid characters

**Base Branch Validation:**
- Verify base_branch exists
- Check base_branch is not in invalid state
- Ensure base_branch is not a protected branch being used unsafely

**Worktree Mode Validation:**
- If worktree=true, verify work_id is provided
- If work_id is missing when worktree=true, ERROR: "work_id required for worktree mode"

**4. CHECK WORKTREE REGISTRY (if worktree=true):**

```bash
# Check if worktree exists for this work_id
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
WORKTREE_CHECK_SCRIPT="$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/check-worktree.sh"

if EXISTING_WORKTREE=$("$WORKTREE_CHECK_SCRIPT" "$WORK_ID" 2>/dev/null); then
    echo "✅ Found existing worktree for work_id $WORK_ID"
    echo "   Path: $EXISTING_WORKTREE"

    # Update registry timestamp (reuse detected)
    "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/register-worktree.sh" "$WORK_ID" "$EXISTING_WORKTREE" "$BRANCH_NAME"

    # Switch to worktree directory
    cd "$EXISTING_WORKTREE"

    # Return early - reusing existing worktree
    WORKTREE_REUSED=true
    WORKTREE_PATH="$EXISTING_WORKTREE"

    # Skip to completion message (Step 9)
    goto STEP_9
else
    echo "🆕 No existing worktree found, will create new worktree"
    WORKTREE_REUSED=false
fi
```

**Note**: Uses `scripts/check-worktree.sh` to check registry and validate worktree path. This script:
- Checks `~/.fractary/repo/worktrees.json` for work_id mapping
- Validates worktree directory still exists
- Removes stale entries automatically
- Returns worktree path if valid, exits with code 1 if not

**5. CHECK PROTECTED BRANCHES:**

```
PROTECTED_BRANCHES = config.defaults.protected_branches
if branch_name in PROTECTED_BRANCHES:
    ERROR: "Cannot create branch with protected branch name: {branch_name}"
    EXIT CODE 10
```

**6. INVOKE HANDLER:**

Invoke the active source control handler skill.

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST use the Skill tool to invoke the handler. The handler skill name is constructed as follows:
1. Read the platform from config: `config.handlers.source_control.active` (e.g., "github")
2. Construct the full skill name: `fractary-repo:handler-source-control-<platform>`
3. For example, if platform is "github", invoke: `fractary-repo:handler-source-control-github`

**DO NOT** use any other handler name pattern. The correct pattern is always `fractary-repo:handler-source-control-<platform>`.

**Branch Creation** (if not reusing worktree):
Use the Skill tool with:
- command: `fractary-repo:handler-source-control-<platform>` (where <platform> is from config)
- Pass parameters: {branch_name, base_branch, force, checkout: false}  (checkout=false for worktree mode)

The handler will:
- Check if branch already exists
- Create branch from base branch
- Return branch creation details with commit SHA

**Worktree Creation** (if worktree=true and not reused):
```bash
# Create worktree using script
WORKTREE_PATH=$("$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/create-worktree.sh" "$BRANCH_NAME" "$WORK_ID")

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Failed to create worktree"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Worktree created: $WORKTREE_PATH"

# Register worktree in registry
"$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/register-worktree.sh" "$WORK_ID" "$WORKTREE_PATH" "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Switch to worktree directory
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
echo "✅ Switched to worktree directory: $WORKTREE_PATH"
```

**Note**: Uses `scripts/create-worktree.sh` which:
- Creates worktree in `.worktrees/` subfolder (within repo root)
- Truncates branch slugs > 80 chars (with hash for uniqueness)
- Returns worktree path on success
- Handles long path names gracefully

**7. VALIDATE RESPONSE:**

- Check handler returned success status (if branch was created)
- Verify branch was created (check Git status)
- Capture commit SHA of branch creation point
- If worktree mode: Confirm worktree directory exists and is accessible
- Confirm current directory is worktree (if worktree mode)

**8. UPDATE REPO CACHE:**

After successful branch creation/checkout, update the repo plugin cache to reflect the new branch:

```bash
# Update repo cache to reflect branch change (triggers issue_id extraction)
plugins/repo/scripts/update-status-cache.sh --quiet
```

This proactively updates:
- Current branch name
- Issue ID (extracted from new branch name)
- PR number (will be empty for newly created branch)

**9. OUTPUT COMPLETION MESSAGE:**

**If worktree reused:**
```
✅ COMPLETED: Branch Manager
Operation: create-branch (worktree reused)
Work ID: {work_id}
Branch: {branch_name}
Worktree: {worktree_path} (reused existing)
───────────────────────────────────────
Next: Continue workflow in existing worktree
```

**If worktree created:**
```
✅ COMPLETED: Branch Manager
Operation: create-branch (worktree created)
Work ID: {work_id}
Branch Created: {branch_name}
Base Branch: {base_branch}
Worktree: {worktree_path}
Commit SHA: {commit_sha}
───────────────────────────────────────
Next: Make changes in worktree and commit
```

**If normal mode (no worktree):**
```
✅ COMPLETED: Branch Manager
Operation: create-branch
Branch Created: {branch_name}
Base Branch: {base_branch}
Commit SHA: {commit_sha}
───────────────────────────────────────
Next: Make changes and use commit-creator skill to commit them
```

<HANDLERS>
This skill uses the handler pattern to support multiple platforms:

- **handler-source-control-github**: GitHub branch operations via Git CLI
- **handler-source-control-gitlab**: GitLab branch operations (stub)
- **handler-source-control-bitbucket**: Bitbucket branch operations (stub)

The active handler is determined by configuration: `config.handlers.source_control.active`
</HANDLERS>

</USAGE_EXAMPLES>

<INTEGRATION>

**Called By:**
- `repo-manager` agent - For programmatic branch creation
- `/repo:branch create` command - For user-initiated branch creation
- FABER `frame-manager` - During Frame phase to create work branches

**Calls:**
- `repo-common` skill - For configuration loading
- `handler-source-control-{platform}` skill - For platform-specific branch operations

**Does NOT Call:**
- branch-namer (name generation is separate, should be done before)
- commit-creator (commits are separate operations)
- branch-pusher (pushing is separate from creation)

</INTEGRATION>

<SAFETY_CHECKS>

Before creating any branch, perform these safety checks:

1. **Working Directory Clean**
   - Check no uncommitted changes
   - Warn if working directory is dirty
   - Option to stash or abort

2. **Base Branch Current**
   - Verify base branch is up to date
   - Warn if base branch is behind remote
   - Option to pull or proceed

3. **Protected Branch Rules**
   - Check branch name against protected list
   - Verify not overwriting protected branch
   - Block operation if unsafe

4. **Authentication**
   - Verify Git credentials available
   - Check platform API authentication
   - Fail early if auth missing

5. **Repository State**
   - Check not in detached HEAD
   - Verify not in merge/rebase state
   - Ensure Git repository is valid

</SAFETY_CHECKS>

## Context Efficiency

This skill is focused and efficient:
- Skill prompt: ~300 lines
- No script execution in context (delegated to handler)
- Clear validation logic
- Structured error handling

By separating branch management from other operations:
- Independent testing
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Reduced coupling with other skills
- Better error isolation
