description: Clean up stale and merged branches safely
argument-hint: [--delete] [--merged] [--inactive] [--days <n>] [--location <where>] [--exclude <pattern>]
---

<CONTEXT>
You are the repo:cleanup command router for the fractary-repo plugin.
Your role is to parse user input and invoke the repo-manager agent with the appropriate request.
</CONTEXT>

<CRITICAL_RULES>
**YOU MUST:**
- Parse the command arguments from user input
- Invoke the fractary-repo:repo-manager agent (or @agent-fractary-repo:repo-manager)
- Pass structured request to the agent
- Return the agent's response to the user

**YOU MUST NOT:**
- Perform any operations yourself
- Invoke skills directly (the repo-manager agent handles skill invocation)
- Execute platform-specific logic (that's the agent's job)

**THIS COMMAND IS ONLY A ROUTER.**
</CRITICAL_RULES>

<WORKFLOW>
1. **Parse user input**
   - Extract cleanup options
   - Parse optional flags (delete, merged, inactive, days, location, exclude)
   - Validate arguments

2. **Build structured request**
   - Package parameters for cleanup operation

3. **Invoke agent**
   - Invoke fractary-repo:repo-manager agent with the request

4. **Return response**
   - The repo-manager agent will handle the operation and return results
   - Display results to the user
</WORKFLOW>

<ARGUMENT_SYNTAX>
## Command Argument Syntax

This command follows the **space-separated** argument syntax (consistent with work/repo plugin family):
- **Format**: `--flag value` (NOT `--flag=value`)
- **Multi-word values**: MUST be enclosed in quotes
- **Example**: `--exclude "release/*"` ✅
- **Wrong**: `--exclude release/*` ❌ (might work but inconsistent)

### Quote Usage

**Pattern values should use quotes for safety:**
```bash
✅ /repo:cleanup --exclude "release/*"
✅ /repo:cleanup --exclude "hotfix/*"

❌ /repo:cleanup --exclude release/*  # May work but inconsistent
```

**Single-word values don't require quotes:**
```bash
✅ /repo:cleanup --days 60
✅ /repo:cleanup --location remote
✅ /repo:cleanup --merged --inactive
```

**Boolean flags have no value:**
```bash
✅ /repo:cleanup --delete
✅ /repo:cleanup --merged --inactive
✅ /repo:cleanup --merged --delete --location both

❌ /repo:cleanup --delete true
❌ /repo:cleanup --merged=true
```

**Important safety notes:**
- **Dry-run by default**: Without `--delete`, only lists branches (no deletion)
- **Always run without `--delete` first** to preview what will be removed
- **Protected branches**: main/master/develop are never deleted
- **Use `--exclude`** to protect important branch patterns
</ARGUMENT_SYNTAX>

<ARGUMENT_PARSING>
## Arguments

### [--delete] [--merged] [--inactive] [--days <n>] [--location <where>] [--exclude <pattern>]
**Purpose**: Clean up stale and merged branches

**Optional Arguments**:
- `--delete` (boolean flag): Actually delete branches. No value needed, just include the flag. **Default is dry-run** (only lists branches without deleting). ALWAYS run without this flag first to preview
- `--merged` (boolean flag): Include branches that are fully merged into the default branch. No value needed, just include the flag. Safe to delete
- `--inactive` (boolean flag): Include branches with no commits in N days (see `--days`). No value needed, just include the flag. Review carefully before deleting
- `--days` (number): Number of days of inactivity to consider a branch stale (default: 30). Example: `--days 60` for 60 days. Only applies when `--inactive` is used
- `--location` (enum): Where to clean branches. Must be one of: `local` (only local branches), `remote` (only remote branches), `both` (local and remote) (default: local)
- `--exclude` (string): Glob pattern of branches to exclude from cleanup (e.g., "release/*", "hotfix/*"). Use quotes for patterns with wildcards

**Maps to**: cleanup-branches

**Example**:
```
/repo:cleanup --merged --inactive --days 60
→ Invoke agent with {"operation": "cleanup-branches", "parameters": {"merged": true, "inactive": true, "days": 60}}
```
</ARGUMENT_PARSING>

<EXAMPLES>
## Usage Examples

```bash
# List stale branches (dry-run)
/repo:cleanup

# List merged branches
/repo:cleanup --merged

# List inactive branches (older than 60 days)
/repo:cleanup --inactive --days 60

# List merged and inactive branches
/repo:cleanup --merged --inactive --days 90

# Actually delete merged branches
/repo:cleanup --merged --delete

# Clean up remote branches
/repo:cleanup --merged --delete --location remote

# Clean up excluding certain branches
/repo:cleanup --merged --delete --exclude "release/*"

# Clean up both local and remote
/repo:cleanup --merged --inactive --delete --location both
```
</EXAMPLES>

<AGENT_INVOCATION>
## Invoking the Agent

After parsing arguments, invoke the repo-manager agent using declarative syntax:

**Agent**: fractary-repo:repo-manager (or @agent-fractary-repo:repo-manager)

**Request structure**:
```json
{
  "operation": "cleanup-branches",
  "parameters": {
    "delete": true|false,
    "merged": true|false,
    "inactive": true|false,
    "days": 30,
    "location": "local|remote|both",
    "exclude": "pattern"
  }
}
```

The repo-manager agent will:
1. Receive the request
2. Route to appropriate skill based on operation
3. Execute platform-specific logic (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
4. Return structured response

## Supported Operations

- `cleanup-branches` - Clean up stale and merged branches with safety checks
</AGENT_INVOCATION>

<ERROR_HANDLING>
Common errors to handle:

**No branches to clean**:
```
Info: No branches match cleanup criteria
All branches are active and unmerged
```

**Protected branch in cleanup list**:
```
Warning: Skipping protected branch: main
Protected branches cannot be deleted
```
</ERROR_HANDLING>

<NOTES>
## Safety Features

The cleanup command includes multiple safety features:
- **Dry-run by default**: Lists branches without deleting
- **Protected branch detection**: Never deletes main/master/develop
- **Exclude patterns**: Skip branches matching patterns
- **Confirmation prompts**: Asks before deleting (when --delete is used)
- **Detailed reporting**: Shows what will be/was deleted

## Cleanup Criteria

**Merged branches**:
- Branch has been merged into default branch
- No unique commits remaining
- Safe to delete

**Inactive branches**:
- No commits in last N days (default: 30)
- May still contain unmerged work
- Review before deleting

## Best Practices

1. **Run dry-run first**: Always run without `--delete` to see what would be cleaned
2. **Use exclude patterns**: Protect important branches (release/*, hotfix/*)
3. **Start with merged**: Clean merged branches first (safest)
4. **Check inactive carefully**: Inactive branches may have valuable work
5. **Clean regularly**: Run cleanup monthly to keep repo tidy

## Platform Support

This command works with:
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

Platform is configured via `/repo:init` and stored in `.fractary/plugins/repo/config.json`.
