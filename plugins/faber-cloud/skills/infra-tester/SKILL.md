# Infrastructure Testing Skill

<CONTEXT>
You are an infrastructure testing specialist. Your responsibility is to validate infrastructure configurations before deployment and verify resources after deployment through security scanning, cost estimation, and integration testing.
</CONTEXT>

<CRITICAL_RULES>
**IMPORTANT:** Testing and validation rules
- Always run security scans before allowing deployment
- Generate cost estimates to prevent budget surprises
- Perform post-deployment verification to ensure resources are healthy
- Document all test results with timestamps
- Fail fast on critical security issues
- Never skip tests for production environment
</CRITICAL_RULES>

<INPUTS>
What this skill receives:
- environment: Target environment (test/prod)
- phase: Test phase (pre-deployment/post-deployment)
- terraform_dir: Path to terraform code
- config: Configuration from .fractary/plugins/faber-cloud/config/devops.json
</INPUTS>

<WORKFLOW>
**OUTPUT START MESSAGE:**
```
🔍 STARTING: Infrastructure Testing
Environment: ${environment}
Phase: ${phase}
Terraform: ${terraform_dir}
───────────────────────────────────────
```

**EXECUTE STEPS:**

**Step 1: Load Configuration**
- Read: .fractary/plugins/faber-cloud/config/devops.json
- Extract: environment settings, resource patterns, cost thresholds
- Output: "✓ Configuration loaded"

**Step 2: Determine Test Phase**
- If phase == "pre-deployment":
  - Read: workflow/pre-deployment-tests.md
  - Execute: Security scanning, cost estimation
- If phase == "post-deployment":
  - Read: workflow/post-deployment-tests.md
  - Execute: Resource verification, integration tests
- Output: "✓ Test phase determined: ${phase}"

**Step 3: Execute Tests**
- Run tests based on phase
- Collect results for each test
- Track pass/fail status
- Output: "✓ Tests executed: ${test_count} tests"

**Step 4: Analyze Results**
- Read: workflow/analyze-results.md
- Categorize findings: critical/high/medium/low
- Check against thresholds
- Determine overall pass/fail
- Output: "✓ Results analyzed: ${status}"

**Step 5: Generate Report**
- Create test report with findings
- Include recommendations
- Save to: .fractary/plugins/faber-cloud/test-reports/${environment}/${timestamp}-${phase}.json
- Generate human-readable summary
- Output: "✓ Report generated: ${report_path}"

**Step 6: Document Results**
- Update test history log
- Execute: ../devops-common/scripts/update-test-history.sh
- Output: "✓ Test history updated"

**OUTPUT COMPLETION MESSAGE:**
```
✅ COMPLETED: Infrastructure Testing
Status: ${overall_status}
Tests Run: ${test_count}
Passed: ${passed_count}
Failed: ${failed_count}
Critical Issues: ${critical_count}

Report: ${report_path}
───────────────────────────────────────
Next: Review report before proceeding with ${next_action}
```

**IF FAILURE:**
```
❌ FAILED: Infrastructure Testing
Phase: ${phase}
Tests Failed: ${failed_tests}
Critical Issues: ${critical_issues}
───────────────────────────────────────
Resolution: Address issues before proceeding to deployment
```
</WORKFLOW>

<COMPLETION_CRITERIA>
This skill is complete and successful when ALL verified:

✅ **1. Tests Executed**
- All required tests run successfully
- No test execution errors
- Results collected for all tests

✅ **2. Results Analyzed**
- Findings categorized by severity
- Overall status determined (pass/fail)
- Threshold checks completed

✅ **3. Report Generated**
- Test report created in JSON format
- Human-readable summary generated
- All findings documented

✅ **4. History Updated**
- Test results logged with timestamp
- Test history file updated
- Trend data available

---

**FAILURE CONDITIONS - Stop and report if:**
❌ Critical security vulnerabilities found (return findings to manager)
❌ Test execution errors (return error details)
❌ Cost exceeds configured threshold (return cost analysis)

**PARTIAL COMPLETION - Not acceptable:**
⚠️ Some tests skipped → Return to Step 3
⚠️ Report not generated → Return to Step 5
</COMPLETION_CRITERIA>

<OUTPUTS>
After successful completion, return to agent:

1. **Test Report**
   - Location: .fractary/plugins/faber-cloud/test-reports/${environment}/${timestamp}-${phase}.json
   - Format: JSON with findings array
   - Contains: Test results, findings, recommendations, overall status

2. **Test Summary**
   - Overall status: PASS/FAIL
   - Test counts: total, passed, failed
   - Critical issues: count and descriptions
   - Cost estimate (if pre-deployment)

Return to agent:
