# Security Considerations for Faber-Cloud Hooks

## Overview

The faber-cloud hook system allows execution of custom logic at infrastructure lifecycle points. This document outlines security considerations and best practices.

## Hook Types and Security Implications

### Script Hooks

**Execution Model:**
- Execute arbitrary bash commands
- Run with same permissions as hook executor
- Access to all environment variables
- Can modify filesystem

**Security Risks:**

1. **Command Injection**
   - Legacy string hooks execute arbitrary commands
   - User-provided configuration could contain malicious commands
   - Template variables could be exploited if not properly escaped

2. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Hooks run with same AWS credentials as deployment
   - Could access/modify resources beyond intended scope
   - Production hooks have production credentials

3. **Credential Exposure**
   - Environment variables may contain sensitive data
   - AWS credentials available via AWS_PROFILE
   - Terraform state may contain secrets

**Mitigation:**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-deploy": [
      {
        "type": "script",
        "path": "./scripts/vetted-script.sh",  // Use explicit paths
        "required": true,
        "timeout": 300  // Enforce timeouts
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use explicit script paths, not commands
- ✅ Store hook scripts in version control
- ✅ Review all hook scripts before deployment
- ✅ Use least-privilege AWS profiles
- ✅ Set restrictive timeouts
- ✅ Avoid passing secrets via command line
- ✅ Log all hook executions

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ String hooks with user input: `"curl $USER_URL"`
- ❌ Wildcard permissions on hook scripts
- ❌ Executing downloaded scripts without verification
- ❌ Long or unlimited timeouts
- ❌ Hooks that require manual input

### Skill Hooks

**Execution Model:**
- Invoke Claude Code skills
- Run in Claude Code runtime environment
- Receive structured WorkflowContext JSON
- Return structured WorkflowResult JSON

**Security Risks:**

1. **Skill Tampering**
   - Malicious skills could be placed in `.claude/skills/`
   - Skills have access to project files and environment
   - Could exfiltrate data or modify infrastructure

2. **Context Exposure**
   - WorkflowContext may contain sensitive paths
   - Configuration could include internal details
   - Artifacts passed between hooks

3. **Privilege Scope**
   - Skills run with same permissions as hook executor
   - Could invoke other Claude Code tools
   - May access Claude Code API if available

**Mitigation:**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-deploy": [
      {
        "type": "skill",
        "name": "approved-validator",  // Only use vetted skills
        "required": true,
        "failureMode": "stop",
        "timeout": 300  // Enforce timeouts
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Only use skills from trusted sources
- ✅ Review skill code before installation
- ✅ Store skills in version control
- ✅ Validate WorkflowContext before passing to skills
- ✅ Audit skill invocations
- ✅ Use sandbox/restricted runtime if available (future)

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Installing skills from untrusted sources
- ❌ Skills that make external network calls
- ❌ Skills that modify production resources directly
- ❌ Unlimited timeouts

## Temporary Files and Permissions

### WorkflowContext Files

The `invoke-skill-hook.sh` script creates temporary files for WorkflowContext:

```bash
# Creates with restrictive permissions (600 - owner only)
context_file=$(mktemp /tmp/workflow-context.XXXXXX.json)
chmod 600 "$context_file"
trap "rm -f $context_file" EXIT
```

**Why this matters:**
- WorkflowContext contains project paths, environment names
- Other users on system could read without restrictive permissions
- Temporary files persist until cleanup

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Always set `chmod 600` on temp files with sensitive data
- ✅ Use trap to ensure cleanup on exit
- ✅ Avoid storing secrets in WorkflowContext
- ✅ Minimize data passed via temp files

## Production Environment Security

### Profile Separation

The faber-cloud plugin uses separate AWS profiles per environment:

```json
{
  "handlers": {
    "hosting": {
      "aws": {
        "profiles": {
          "discover": "project-discover-deploy",
          "test": "project-test-deploy",
          "prod": "project-prod-deploy"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Model:**
- **discover**: Temporary profile for IAM management
- **test**: Test environment deployment (no IAM permissions)
- **prod**: Production deployment (no IAM permissions)

**Hooks inherit profile:**
- Pre-deploy hooks run with test/prod credentials
- Could access/modify any resource in that environment
- Must be reviewed carefully for production

### Production Hook Checklist

Before deploying hooks to production:

- [ ] All hook scripts reviewed and approved
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Timeouts set appropriately
- [ ] Failure modes configured (required hooks should block)
- [ ] Hooks tested in test environment first
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Least-privilege principle applied
- [ ] No external network calls (or approved and documented)
- [ ] Skills from trusted sources only

## Audit and Monitoring

### Hook Execution Logging

All hook executions are logged with:
- Hook name and type
- Environment and operation
- Start time and duration
- Success/failure status
- Exit code

**Log location:** Output of hook executor

**Recommendations:**
- ✅ Capture hook executor output
- ✅ Send to centralized logging (CloudWatch, etc.)
- ✅ Alert on hook failures
- ✅ Monitor for suspicious patterns (unusual execution times, repeated failures)

### Audit Trail

For production environments, maintain audit trail:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-07T12:00:00Z",
  "environment": "prod",
  "hook_type": "pre-deploy",
  "hook_name": "build-lambdas",
  "success": true,
  "duration_ms": 45000,
  "user": "deploy-user"
}
```

## Incident Response

### Compromised Hook Script

If a hook script is compromised:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable hook in configuration
   - Review recent hook executions
   - Check for unauthorized resource access
   - Rotate AWS credentials if needed

2. **Investigation:**
   - Identify when script was modified
   - Review git history
   - Check for data exfiltration
   - Assess blast radius

3. **Remediation:**
   - Replace with known-good version
   - Update access controls
   - Strengthen review process
   - Document incident

### Suspicious Hook Activity

Signs of compromise:
- ❌ Hook execution times unusually long
- ❌ Hook failures after working previously
- ❌ Unexpected network activity
- ❌ New hooks added without approval
- ❌ Modified hook scripts in version control

**Response:**
1. Investigate immediately
2. Disable suspicious hooks
3. Review CloudWatch logs for resource access
4. Check CloudTrail for API calls
5. Assess damage and contain

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR / Data Privacy

WorkflowContext may contain:
- Project names (could be customer names)
- Environment names
- File paths
- Configuration data

**Recommendations:**
- ✅ Minimize data in WorkflowContext
- ✅ Don't include customer PII
- ✅ Secure temporary files (chmod 600)
- ✅ Clean up temp files promptly

### SOC 2 / Security Audits

For compliance audits:
- ✅ Document all hooks and their purpose
- ✅ Maintain audit trail of executions
- ✅ Review process for new hooks
- ✅ Approval workflow for production hooks
- ✅ Regular security reviews
- ✅ Access controls on hook scripts

## Security Testing

### Testing Hooks Before Production

1. **Test Environment First:**
   ```bash
   # Test in test environment
   /fractary-faber-cloud:deploy-apply --env=test

   # Review hook output
   # Verify no security issues
   ```

2. **Security Review:**
   - Static analysis of hook scripts
   - Check for command injection vulnerabilities
   - Review AWS API calls
   - Verify no secrets in code

3. **Permission Testing:**
   - Verify hooks work with least-privilege profile
   - Test failure modes
   - Confirm timeouts enforced

### Automated Security Checks

**Pre-commit hooks:**
```bash
# Check for secrets in hook scripts
git diff --cached --name-only | grep 'scripts/' | xargs grep -E 'password|secret|key'

# Verify no hardcoded credentials
git diff --cached --name-only | grep 'scripts/' | xargs grep -E 'AKIA|aws_access_key'
```
