## Comment Formatting

Comments support markdown formatting on most platforms:

```bash
# Bold and italic
/work:comment create 123 "**Important:** This is *critical*"

# Code blocks
/work:comment create 123 "Fixed by updating \`auth.js\`"

# Lists
/work:comment create 123 "TODO:
- Test login flow
- Test logout flow
- Update docs"

# Links
/work:comment create 123 "Related to #456 and fixed in PR #789"
```

## Error Handling

**Missing Issue Number**:
```
Error: issue_number is required
Usage: /work:comment create <issue_number> <text>
```

**Missing Comment Text**:
```
Error: comment text is required
Usage: /work:comment create <issue_number> <text>
```

**Invalid Issue Number**:
```
Error: Issue not found: #999
Verify the issue number and try again
```

**Empty Comment**:
```
Error: Comment text cannot be empty

```

## Integration

**Called By**: User via CLI, FABER workflows

**Calls**: work-manager agent with operations:
- create-comment
- list-comments

**Returns**: Human-readable output formatted for terminal display

## Platform-Specific Behavior

### GitHub Issues

- Comments support full GitHub Flavored Markdown
- @mentions notify users
- Issue and PR references auto-link (#123, owner/repo#456)
- Reactions available (üëç, ‚ù§Ô∏è, etc.) via web UI
- Comments can be edited/deleted via web UI

### Jira

- Comments support Jira wiki markup or markdown (depending on configuration)
- @mentions use Jira user format
- Issue references auto-link (PROJ-123)
- Comments can be internal (restricted visibility)
- Edit history tracked automatically

### Linear

- Comments support Linear markdown
- @mentions notify team members
- Issue references auto-link (TEAM-123)
- Comments appear in Linear activity feed
- Inline reactions supported

## FABER Integration

When used within FABER workflows, comments automatically include:
- Phase information (Frame, Architect, Build, Evaluate, Release)
- Workflow progress updates
- Links to commits and PRs
- Test results and validation status

**Example FABER Comment**:
```
üèóÔ∏è FABER Phase: Build

Implementation completed for CSV export feature.

Changes:
- Added export service (src/services/export.js)
- Created API endpoint (/api/export)
- Added unit tests (95% coverage)

Commit: abc123
Status: Ready for review

Next: Moving to Evaluate phase
```

These comments are posted automatically by FABER workflows when:
- Phase transitions occur
- Important milestones are reached
- Errors or blockers are encountered
- Workflow completes successfully

## Advanced Usage

**Multi-line Comments**:
```bash
/work:comment create 123 "Investigation results:

Root cause: Race condition in auth middleware
Impact: Login failures during high load
Solution: Add mutex lock in validateToken()

PR coming soon."
```

**Reference Other Issues**:
```bash
/work:comment create 123 "This is related to #456 and blocks #789"
```

**Mention Users**:
```bash
/work:comment create 123 "@alice can you review? @bob FYI"
```

**Code Snippets**:
```bash
/work:comment create 123 "The fix:
\`\`\`javascript
async function validateToken(token) {
  await mutex.acquire();
  try {
    return await verify(token);
  } finally {
    mutex.release();
  }
}
\`\`\`"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Provide clear, actionable information in comments
2. **Use formatting**: Leverage markdown for readability
3. **Reference related work**: Link to issues, PRs, and commits
4. **Tag relevant people**: @mention users who need to see the comment
5. **Update on progress**: Keep stakeholders informed with regular updates
6. **Include context**: Add debugging info, test results, or reproduction steps
7. **Be professional**: Comments are part of project history

## Common Use Cases

### Progress Update
```bash
/work:comment create 123 "**Progress Update**
- ‚úÖ Implemented core logic
- ‚úÖ Added unit tests
- üîÑ Working on integration tests
- ‚è≥ Documentation pending

ETA: End of day"
```

### Bug Investigation
```bash
/work:comment create 456 "**Investigation Results**

Reproduced the issue in staging. Occurs when:
1. User has multiple sessions
2. Token refresh happens simultaneously
3. Race condition in token validation

Root cause: Missing lock in \`auth.validateToken()\`
Fix in progress."
```

### Review Request
```bash
/work:comment create 789 "PR #234 is ready for review

Changes:
- Refactored user service
- Added caching layer
- Updated API docs

Tests passing, coverage at 92%
@reviewerteam please review"
```

### Blocked Status
```bash
/work:comment create 321 "‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocked**

Waiting on infrastructure team to provision database.
Ticket: OPS-456

Cannot proceed until this is resolved."
```

## Notes

- Comments are immutable once posted (platform-dependent editing)
- All comments are visible to users with access to the issue
- Markdown support varies by platform
- Some platforms support internal/private comments
- Comment notifications depend on platform settings
- FABER workflows post automated comments for tracking
- Long comments may be truncated in list view
